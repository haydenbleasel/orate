Orate provides a simple and unified API for transcribing audio into text using various AI providers. The speech-to-text functionality is accessible through the `transcribe` function.

## Basic Usage

The basic usage involves importing the `transcribe` function from Orate and your chosen provider. For example, to use OpenAI's speech-to-text model, you can import the `OpenAI` provider and use its `stt` function:

```tsx
import { transcribe } from 'orate';
import { openai } from 'orate/providers/openai';
import audioFile from './audio.wav';

const transcription = await transcribe({
  model: openai.stt(),
  audio: audioFile,
});
```

### `model`

The `model` parameter is a function that returns a model instance. The model instance is a function that takes an audio file and returns a promise that resolves to the transcription of the audio.

```tsx
const model = openai.stt();
```

### `audio`

The `audio` parameter is a `File` object that contains the audio data to be transcribed.

```tsx
const audio = new File([audioBuffer], 'audio.wav', { type: 'audio/wav' });
```

## Why use a `File` object?

The `File` object is used because it is the most common format for audio data. It is supported by all major browsers and can be easily converted to other formats. Additionally, the various AI providers require the audio data to be in a specific format, and the `File` object is the most convenient way to determine the audio format.

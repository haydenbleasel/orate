Orate provides a simple and unified API for transcribing audio into text using various AI providers. The speech-to-text functionality is accessible through the `transcribe` function.

## Basic Usage

The basic usage involves importing the `transcribe` function from Orate and your chosen provider. For example, to use OpenAI's speech-to-text model, you can import the `OpenAI` provider and use its `stt` function:

```tsx
import { transcribe } from 'orate';
import { openai } from 'orate/providers/openai';

const transcription = await transcribe({
  model: openai.stt(),
  audio: audioBuffer,
});
```

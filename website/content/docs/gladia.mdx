import { AutoTypeTable } from 'fumadocs-typescript/ui';

Gladia provide infrastructure to transform note-taking, customer support, sales assistance, user experience, and more. From async to live streaming, their API empowers your platform with accurate, multilingual speech-to-text and actionable insights.

## Setup

The Gladia provider is available by default in Orate. To import it, you can use the following code:

```ts
import { gladia } from 'orate/gladia';
```

## Configuration

The Gladia provider looks for the `GLADIA_API_KEY` environment variable. This variable is required for the provider to work. Simply add the following to your `.env` file:

```bash
GLADIA_API_KEY="your_api_key"
```

## Usage

The Gladia provider provides a single interface for all of Gladia's transcription services.

### Speech to Text

The Gladia provider provides a `stt` function that allows you to create a speech-to-text transcription function using Gladia. By default, the `stt` function uses the `best` model.

```tsx
import { transcribe } from 'orate';
import { gladia } from 'orate/gladia';

const text = await transcribe({
  model: gladia.stt(),
  audio: someArrayBuffer,
});
```

You can specify the model to use by passing it as an argument to the `stt` function. By default, the `stt` function uses the `base` model.

```tsx
const text = await transcribe({
  model: gladia.stt('enhanced'),
  audio: someArrayBuffer,
});
```

You can also specify specific Gladia properties by passing them as an argument to the `stt` function.

```tsx
const text = await transcribe({
  model: gladia.stt('enhanced', {
    chapterization: true,
  }),
  audio: someArrayBuffer,
});
```

## Typescript Definitions

The Gladia provider provides Typescript definitions for the `stt` function.

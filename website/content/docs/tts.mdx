Orate provides a simple and unified API for converting text into speech using various AI providers. The text-to-speech functionality is accessible through the `speak` function.

## Basic Usage

The basic usage involves importing the `speak` function from Orate and your chosen provider. For example, to use OpenAI's text-to-speech model, you can import the `OpenAI` provider and use its `tts` function:

```tsx
import { speak } from 'orate';
import { openai } from 'orate/providers/openai';

const transcription = await speak({
  model: openai.tts(),
  prompt: 'Hello, world!',
});
```

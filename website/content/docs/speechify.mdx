import { AutoTypeTable } from 'fumadocs-typescript/ui';

Speechify offer a text-to-speech API that delivers their most natural and beloved AI voices directly to developers worldwide.

## Setup

The Speechify provider is available by default in Orate. To import it, you can use the following code:

```ts
import { speechify } from 'orate/speechify';
```

## Configuration

The Speechify provider looks for the `SPEECHIFY_API_KEY` environment variable. This variable is required for the provider to work. Simply add the following to your `.env` file:

```bash
SPEECHIFY_API_KEY="your_api_key"
```

## Usage

The Speechify provider provides a single interface for all of Speechify's speech services.

### Text to Speech

The Speechify provider provides a `tts` function that allows you to create a text-to-speech synthesis function using Speechify's TTS. By default, the `tts` function uses the `simba-multilingual` model and the `george` voice.

```tsx
import { speak } from 'orate';
import { speechify } from 'orate/speechify';

const speech = await speak({
  model: speechify.tts(),
  prompt: 'Hello, world!',
});
```

You can specify the model and voice to use by passing them as arguments to the `tts` function.

```tsx
const speech = await speak({
  model: speechify.tts('simba-turbo', 'kristy'),
  prompt: 'Hello, world!',
});
```

You can also specify specific Speechify properties by passing them as an argument to the `tts` function.

```tsx
const speech = await speak({
  model: speechify.tts('simba-turbo', 'kristy', {
    options: {
      enableLoudnessNormalization: true,
    }
  }),
  prompt: 'Hello, world!',
});
```

Orate provides a simple and unified API for converting text into speech using various AI providers. The text-to-speech functionality is accessible through the `speak` function.

## Usage

The basic usage involves importing the `speak` function from Orate and your chosen provider. For example, to use OpenAI's text-to-speech model, you can import the `OpenAI` provider and use its `tts` function:

```ts
import { speak } from 'orate';
import { openai } from 'orate/openai';

const transcription = await speak({
  model: openai.tts(),
  prompt: 'Hello, world!',
});
```

### `model`

The `model` parameter is a function that returns a model instance. The model instance is a function that takes a prompt and returns a promise that resolves to the speech of the prompt.

```ts
const model = openai.tts();
```

### `prompt`

The `prompt` parameter is a string that contains the text to be converted into speech.

```ts
const prompt = 'Hello, world!';
```

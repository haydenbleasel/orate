description: Change the voice of your audio with AI

Orate provides a simple and unified API for changing the voice of your audio using various AI providers. The speech-to-speech functionality is accessible through the `change` function.

## Usage

The basic usage involves importing the `change` function from Orate and your chosen provider. For example, to use ElevenLabs' speech-to-speech model, you can import the `ElevenLabs` provider and use its `sts` function:

```ts
import { change } from 'orate';
import { elevenlabs } from 'orate/elevenlabs';
import audioFile from './audio.wav';

const newAudio = await change({
  model: elevenlabs.sts(),
  audio: audioFile,
});
```

### `model`

The `model` parameter is a function that returns a model instance. The model instance is a function that takes an audio file and returns a promise that resolves to the new audio.

```ts
const model = elevenlabs.sts();
```

### `audio`

The `audio` parameter is a `File` object that contains the audio data to be changed.

```ts
const audio = new File([audioBuffer], 'audio.wav', { type: 'audio/wav' });
```

Orate uses a `File` object because it is supported by all major browsers and can be easily converted to other formats. Additionally, the various AI providers require the audio data to be in a specific format, and the `File` object is the most convenient way to determine the audio format.

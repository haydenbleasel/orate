title: Speech Isolation
description: Isolate speech from the audio using leading AI providers.
---

Orate provides a simple and unified API for isolating speech from the audio using various AI providers. It's a very handy function for removing background noise from chaotic audio. The speech isolation functionality is accessible through the `isolate` function.

## Usage

The basic usage involves importing the `isolate` function from Orate and your chosen provider. For example, to use ElevenLabs' speech isolation model, you can import the `ElevenLabs` provider and use its `isl` function:

```ts
import { isolate } from 'orate';
import { elevenlabs } from 'orate/elevenlabs';

const transcription = await isolate({
  model: elevenlabs.isl(),
  audio,
});
```

### `model`

The `model` parameter is a function that returns a model instance. The model instance is a function that takes a prompt and returns a promise that resolves to the speech of the prompt.

```ts
const model = elevenlabs.isl();
```

### `audio`

The `audio` parameter is a File object that contains the audio to be processed.

```ts
const audio = new File([], 'test.mp3', { type: 'audio/mp3' });
```

Rev AI offers an accurate API for AI and human-generated transcripts. Trained from the most diverse collection of voices in the world, Rev AI sets the accuracy standard for video and voice applications.

## Setup

The Rev AI provider is available by default in Orate. To import it, you can use the following code:

```ts
import { Rev } from 'orate/rev';
```

## Configuration

The Rev AI provider looks for the `REV_API_KEY` environment variable. This variable is required for the provider to work. Simply add the following to your `.env` file:

```bash
REV_API_KEY="your_api_key"
```

## Usage

The Rev AI provider provides a single interface for all of Rev AI's transcription services.

### Speech to Text

The Rev AI provider provides a `stt` function that allows you to create a speech-to-text transcription function using Rev AI. By default, the `stt` function uses the `machine` model.

```ts
import { transcribe } from 'orate';
import { Rev } from 'orate/rev';

const text = await transcribe({
  model: new Rev().stt(),
  audio: new File(...),
});
```

You can specify the model to use by passing it as an argument to the `stt` function. By default, the `stt` function uses the `base` model.

```ts
const text = await transcribe({
  model: new Rev().stt('fusion'),
  audio: new File(...),
});
```

You can also specify specific Rev AI properties by passing them as an argument to the `stt` function.

```ts
const text = await transcribe({
  model: new Rev().stt('fusion', {
    remove_disfluencies: true,
  }),
  audio: new File(...),
});
```

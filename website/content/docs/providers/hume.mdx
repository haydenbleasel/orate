Hume is a LLM for text-to-speech synthesis, allowing you to generate realistic speech with unique voices. Orate allows you to use this service with a single API.

## Setup

The Hume provider is available by default in Orate. To import it, you can use the following code:

```ts
import { Hume } from 'orate/hume';
```

## Configuration

You can use Hume by creating a new instance of the `Hume` class:

```ts
const hume = new Hume();
```

This will use the `HUME_API_KEY` environment variable. If you don't have this variable set, you can pass your API key as an argument to the constructor.

```ts
const hume = new Hume('your_api_key');
```

## Usage

The Hume provider provides a single interface for all of Hume's text-to-speech services.

### Text to Speech

The Hume provider provides a `tts` function that allows you to create a text-to-speech synthesis function using Hume TTS.

Hume is unique in that it allows you to describe the voice you want to use in natural language. For example:

```ts
import { speak } from 'orate';
import { Hume } from 'orate/hume';

const speech = await speak({
  model: new Hume().tts('A medieval knight'),
  prompt: 'Hello, world!',
});
```

If you have a voice saved in your library, you can use the voice's name to describe it.

```ts
const speech = await speak({
  model: new Hume().tts('A medieval knight', 'voice_id'),
  prompt: 'Hello, world!',
});
```

You can also specify specific Hume properties by passing them as an argument to the `tts` function.

```ts
const speech = await speak({
  model: new Hume().tts('A medieval knight', 'voice_id', {
    numGenerations: 3,
  }),
  prompt: 'Hello, world!',
});
```

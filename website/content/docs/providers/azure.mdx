Azure Cognitive Services by Microsoft are a collection of artificial intelligence (AI) APIs that help developers create applications with advanced AI capabilities. These services are available on Microsoft Azure, a cloud computing platform. 

## Setup

The Azure provider is available by default in Orate. To import it, you can use the following code:

```ts
import { Azure } from 'orate/azure';
```

## Configuration

You can use Azure by creating a new instance of the `Azure` class:

```ts
const azure = new Azure();
```

This will use the `AZURE_API_KEY` and `AZURE_REGION` environment variables. If you don't have these variables set, you can pass your keys as an argument to the constructor.

```ts
const azure = new Azure({
  apiKey: 'your_api_key',
  region: 'your_region',
});
```

## Usage

The Azure provider provides a single interface for all of Azure's speech and transcription services.

### Text to Speech

The Azure provider provides a `tts` function that allows you to create a text-to-speech synthesis function using Azure Speech Service.

```ts
import { speak } from 'orate';
import { Azure } from 'orate/azure';

const speech = await speak({
  model: new Azure().tts(),
  prompt: 'Hello, world!',
});
```

You can specify the voice to use by passing it as an argument to the `tts` function.

```ts
const speech = await speak({
  model: new Azure().tts('en-US-AriaNeural'),
  prompt: 'Hello, world!',
});
```

You can also stream the speech.

```ts
const speech = await speak({
  model: new Azure().tts(),
  prompt: 'Hello, world!',
  stream: true,
});
```

### Speech to Text

The Azure provider provides a `stt` function that allows you to create a speech-to-text transcription function using Azure Speech Service.

```ts
import { transcribe } from 'orate';
import { Azure } from 'orate/azure';

const text = await transcribe({
  model: new Azure().stt(),
  audio: new File(...),
});
```

You can also stream the transcription.

```ts
const text = await transcribe({
  model: new Azure().stt(),
  audio: new File(...),
  stream: true,
});
```

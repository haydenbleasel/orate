Fal is a generative media platform for developers, helping you build the next generation of creativity. Orate supports Fal's transcription services.

## Setup

The Fal provider is available by default in Orate. To import it, you can use the following code:

```ts
import { fal } from 'orate/fal';
```

## Configuration

The Fal provider looks for the `FAL_API_KEY` environment variable. This variable is required for the provider to work. Simply add the following to your `.env` file:

```bash
FAL_API_KEY="your_api_key"
```

## Usage

The Fal provider provides a single interface for all of Fal's transcription services.

### Speech to Text

The Fal provider provides a `stt` function that allows you to create a speech-to-text transcription function using Fal's models. By default, the `stt` function uses the `fal-ai/whisper` model.

```ts
import { transcribe } from 'orate';
import { fal } from 'orate/fal';

const text = await transcribe({
  model: fal.stt(),
  audio: new File(...),
});
```

You can specify the model to use by passing it as an argument to the `stt` function.

```ts
const text = await transcribe({
  model: fal.stt('fal-ai/wizper'),
  audio: new File(...),
});
```

You can also specify specific Fal properties by passing them as an argument to the `stt` function.

```ts
const text = await transcribe({
  model: fal.stt('fal-ai/wizper', {
    diarize: true,
  }),
  audio: new File(...),
});
```

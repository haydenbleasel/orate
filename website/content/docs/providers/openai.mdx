OpenAI is a leading provider of AI services, offering a wide range of speech and transcription services through their Large Language Models (LLMs). Orate allows you to use these services with a single API, making it easy to switch between providers and use the best AI services for your needs.

## Setup

The OpenAI provider is available by default in Orate. To import it, you can use the following code:

```ts
import { OpenAI } from 'orate/openai';
```

## Configuration

You can use OpenAI by creating a new instance of the `OpenAI` class:

```ts
const openai = new OpenAI();
```

This will use the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable. If you don't have this variable set, you can pass your API key as an argument to the constructor.

```ts
const openai = new OpenAI('your_api_key');
```

## Usage

The OpenAI provider provides a single interface for all of OpenAI's speech and transcription services.

### Text to Speech

The OpenAI provider provides a `tts` function that allows you to create a text-to-speech synthesis function using OpenAI TTS. By default, the `tts` function uses the `tts-1` model and the `alloy` voice.

```ts
import { speak } from 'orate';
import { OpenAI } from 'orate/openai';

const speech = await speak({
  model: new OpenAI().tts(),
  prompt: 'Hello, world!',
});
```

You can specify the model and voice to use by passing them as arguments to the `tts` function.

```ts
const speech = await speak({
  model: new OpenAI().tts('gpt-4o-mini-tts', 'alloy'),
  prompt: 'Hello, world!',
});
```

You can also specify specific OpenAI properties by passing them as an argument to the `tts` function.

```ts
const speech = await speak({
  model: new OpenAI().tts('gpt-4o-mini-tts', 'alloy', {
    speed: 1.25,
  }),
  prompt: 'Hello, world!',
});
```

### Speech to Text

The OpenAI provider provides a `stt` function that allows you to create a speech-to-text transcription function using OpenAI Whisper. By default, the `stt` function uses the `whisper-1` model.

```ts
import { transcribe } from 'orate';
import { OpenAI } from 'orate/openai';

const text = await transcribe({
  model: new OpenAI().stt(),
  audio: new File(...),
});
```

You can specify the model to use by passing it as an argument to the `stt` function.

```ts
const text = await transcribe({
  model: new OpenAI().stt('gpt-4o-mini-transcribe'),
  audio: new File(...),
});
```

You can also specify specific OpenAI properties by passing them as an argument to the `stt` function.

```ts
const text = await transcribe({
  model: new OpenAI().stt('gpt-4o-mini-transcribe', {
    temperature: 0.5,
  }),
  audio: new File(...),
});
```

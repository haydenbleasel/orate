Cleanvoice helps you remove background noise, filler words, long silence, and mouth sounds from your podcast using AI. Orate supports Cleanvoice's speech-to-text and speech isolation services.

## Setup

The CleanVoice provider is available by default in Orate. To import it, you can use the following code:

```ts
import { CleanVoice } from 'orate/cleanvoice';
```

## Configuration

You can use CleanVoice by creating a new instance of the `CleanVoice` class:

```ts
const cleanvoice = new CleanVoice();
```

This will use the `CLEANVOICE_API_KEY` environment variable. If you don't have this variable set, you can pass your API key as an argument to the constructor.

```ts
const cleanvoice = new CleanVoice('your_api_key');
```

## Usage

The CleanVoice provider provides a single interface for all of CleanVoice's speech services.

### Speech to Text

The CleanVoice provider provides a `stt` function that allows you to create a speech-to-text transcription function using CleanVoice.

```ts
import { transcribe } from 'orate';
import { CleanVoice } from 'orate/cleanvoice';

const text = await transcribe({
  model: new CleanVoice().stt(),
  audio: new File(...),
});
```

You can also specify specific CleanVoice properties by passing them as an argument to the `stt` function.

```ts
const text = await transcribe({
  model: new CleanVoice().stt({
    long_silences: true,
  }),
  audio: new File(...),
});
```

### Speech Isolation

The CleanVoice provider provides a `isl` function that allows you to isolate the speech from the audio.

```ts
import { isolate } from 'orate';
import { CleanVoice } from 'orate/cleanvoice';

const speech = await isolate({
  model: new CleanVoice().isl(),
  audio: new File(...),
});
```

You can also specify specific CleanVoice properties by passing them as an argument to the `isl` function.

```ts
const speech = await isolate({
  model: new CleanVoice().isl({
    long_silences: true,
  }),
  audio: new File(...),
});
```

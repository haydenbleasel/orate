Murf is a leading provider of AI services, offering a wide range of speech services through their Large Language Models (LLMs). Orate allows you to use these services with a single API, making it easy to switch between providers and use the best AI services for your needs.

## Setup

The Murf provider is available by default in Orate. To import it, you can use the following code:

```ts
import { Murf } from 'orate/murf';
```

## Configuration

The Murf provider looks for the `MURF_API_KEY` environment variable. This variable is required for the provider to work. Simply add the following to your `.env` file:

```bash
MURF_API_KEY="your_api_key"
```

## Usage

The Murf provider provides a single interface for all of Murf's speech services.

### Text to Speech

The Murf provider provides a `tts` function that allows you to create a text-to-speech synthesis function using Murf's TTS. By default, the `tts` function uses the `GEN2` model and the `en-US-natalie` voice.

```ts
import { speak } from 'orate';
import { Murf } from 'orate/murf';

const speech = await speak({
  model: new Murf().tts(),
  prompt: 'Hello, world!',
});
```

You can specify the model and voice to use by passing them as arguments to the `tts` function.

```ts
const speech = await speak({
  model: new Murf().tts('GEN1', 'en-AU-joyce'),
  prompt: 'Hello, world!',
});
```

You can also specify specific Murf properties by passing them as an argument to the `tts` function.

```ts
const speech = await speak({
  model: new Murf().tts('GEN1', 'en-AU-joyce', {
    pitch: 25,
  }),
  prompt: 'Hello, world!',
});
```

import { AutoTypeTable } from 'fumadocs-typescript/ui';

Deepgramâ€™s voice AI platform provides APIs for speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and full speech-to-speech voice agents.

## Setup

The Deepgram provider is available by default in Orate. To import it, you can use the following code:

```ts
import { Deepgram } from 'orate/deepgram';
```

## Configuration

You can use Deepgram by creating a new instance of the `Deepgram` class:

```ts
const deepgram = new Deepgram();
```

This will use the `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` environment variable. If you don't have this variable set, you can pass your API key as an argument to the constructor.

```ts
const deepgram = new Deepgram('your_api_key');
```

## Usage

The Deepgram provider provides a single interface for all of Deepgram's speech and transcription services.

### Text to Speech

The Deepgram provider provides a `tts` function that allows you to create a text-to-speech synthesis function using Deepgram TTS. By default, the `tts` function uses the `aura` model with the `asteria-en` voice.

```ts
import { speak } from 'orate';
import { Deepgram } from 'orate/deepgram';

const speech = await speak({
  model: new Deepgram().tts(),
  prompt: 'Hello, world!',
});
```

You can specify the model and voice to use by passing them as arguments to the `tts` function.

```ts
const speech = await speak({
  model: new Deepgram().tts('aura', 'luna-en'),
  prompt: 'Hello, world!',
});
```

You can also specify specific Deepgram properties by passing them as an argument to the `tts` function.

```ts
const speech = await speak({
  model: new Deepgram().tts('aura', 'luna-en', {
    sample_rate: 16000
  }),
  prompt: 'Hello, world!',
});
```

You can also stream the speech.

```ts
const speech = await speak({
  model: new Deepgram().tts(),
  prompt: 'Hello, world!',
  stream: true,
});
```

### Speech to Text

The Deepgram provider provides a `stt` function that allows you to create a speech-to-text transcription function using Deepgram's speech-to-text model. By default, the `stt` function uses the `nova-2` model.

```ts
import { transcribe } from 'orate';
import { Deepgram } from 'orate/deepgram';

const text = await transcribe({
  model: new Deepgram().stt(),
  audio: new File(...),
});
```

You can specify the model to use by passing it as an argument to the `stt` function.

```ts
const text = await transcribe({
  model: new Deepgram().stt('enhanced'),
  audio: new File(...),
});
```

You can also specify specific Deepgram properties by passing them as an argument to the `stt` function.

```ts
const text = await transcribe({
  model: new Deepgram().stt('enhanced', {
    filler_words: true,
  }),
  audio: new File(...),
});
```

You can also stream the transcription.

```ts
const text = await transcribe({
  model: new Deepgram().stt(),
  audio: new File(...),
  stream: true,
});
```

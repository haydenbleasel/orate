import { AutoTypeTable } from 'fumadocs-typescript/ui';

Replicate makes machine learning as easy to use as any other type of software. It has a library of hundreds of open-source models that you can run with a few lines of code. And if youâ€™re building your own machine learning models, Replicate makes it easy to deploy them at scale. Orate supports any Replicate model.

## Setup

The Replicate provider is available by default in Orate. To import it, you can use the following code:

```ts
import { Replicate } from 'orate/replicate';
```

## Configuration

The Replicate provider looks for the `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` environment variable. This variable is required for the provider to work. Simply add the following to your `.env` file:

```bash
REPLICATE_API_TOKEN="your_api_token"
```

## Usage

The Replicate provider provides a single interface for all of Replicate's speech and transcription models.

### Text to Speech

The Replicate provider provides a `tts` function that allows you to create a text-to-speech synthesis function using Replicate's TTS models. The Replicate provider is unique in the fact that it requires both an `inputTransformer` and an `outputTransformer` to be passed to the `tts` function.

This is because every model on Replicate has a different input and output format. We'll cover how to create these transformers in the next section. For example, the following code creates a text-to-speech synthesis function using the `jaaari/kokoro-82m` model.

```ts
import { speak } from 'orate';
import { Replicate } from 'orate/replicate';
import { inputTransformer, outputTransformer } from './kokoro-82m-utils';

const speech = await speak({
  model: new Replicate().tts('jaaari/kokoro-82m:dfdf537ba482b029e0a761699e6f55e9162cfd159270bfe0e44857caa5f275a6', inputTransformer, outputTransformer),
  prompt: 'Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears!'
});
```

#### Input Transformer

The `inputTransformer` is a function that takes the Orate input and transforms it into the format that the model expects. In this instance, `jaaari/kokoro-82m` expects an object with a `text` property. Let's create an input transformer for this:

```ts title="kokoro-82m-utils.ts"
export const inputTransformer = (prompt: string) => ({
  input: { text: prompt },
});
```

#### Output Transformer

The `outputTransformer` is a function that takes the model output and transforms it into the format that Orate expects. In this instance, `jaaari/kokoro-82m` returns a stream of audio data. Let's create an output transformer for this:

```ts title="kokoro-82m-utils.ts"
export const outputTransformer = async (response: unknown) => {
  const stream = response as ReadableStream;
  const reader = stream.getReader();
  const chunks: Uint8Array[] = [];

  while (true) {
    const { done, value } = await reader.read();

    if (done) {
      break;
    }

    chunks.push(value);
  }

  const blob = new Blob(chunks, { type: 'audio/mpeg' });

  return new File([blob], 'speech.mp3', {
    type: 'audio/mpeg',
  });
};
```

### Speech to Text

The Replicate provider provides a `stt` function that allows you to create a speech-to-text transcription function using any Replicate speech-to-text model.

Again, the Replicate provider is unique in the fact that it requires both an `inputTransformer` and an `outputTransformer` to be passed to the `stt` function. We'll cover how to create these transformers in the next section.

For example, the following code creates a speech-to-text transcription function using the `vaibhavs10/incredibly-fast-whisper` model.

```ts
import { transcribe } from 'orate';
import { Replicate } from 'orate/replicate';
import { inputTransformer, outputTransformer } from './incredibly-fast-whisper-utils';
import audio from './audio.wav';

const text = await transcribe({
  model: new Replicate().stt('vaibhavs10/incredibly-fast-whisper:3ab86df6c8f54c11309d4d1f930ac292bad43ace52d10c80d87eb258b3c9f79c', inputTransformer, outputTransformer),
  audio,
});
```

#### Input Transformer

The `inputTransformer` is a function that takes the Orate input and transforms it into the format that the model expects. In this instance, `vaibhavs10/incredibly-fast-whisper` expects an object with an `input.audio` property. Also, the `input.audio` property must be a hosted URL. Let's create an input transformer for this:

```ts title="incredibly-fast-whisper-utils.ts"
export const inputTransformer = (audio: File) => {
  // Upload audio somewhere
  const url = 'https://www.acme.com/test.mp3';
  
  return { input: { audio: url } };
};
```

#### Output Transformer

The `outputTransformer` is a function that takes the model output and transforms it into the format that Orate expects. In this instance, `vaibhavs10/incredibly-fast-whisper` returns a string. Let's create an output transformer for this:

```ts title="incredibly-fast-whisper-utils.ts"
export const outputTransformer = (response: unknown) => (
  (response as { text: string }).text
);
```

### Speech Isolation

The Replicate provider provides a `isl` function that allows you to create a speech isolation function using Replicate's speech isolation model.

```ts
import { isolate } from 'orate';
import { Replicate } from 'orate/replicate';
import { inputTransformer, outputTransformer } from './audiosep-utils';

const speech = await isolate({
  model: new Replicate().isl(
    'cjwbw/audiosep:f07004438b8f3e6c5b720ba889389007cbf8dbbc9caa124afc24d9bbd2d307b8', 
    inputTransformer,
    outputTransformer,
  ),
  audio,
});
```

#### Input Transformer

The `inputTransformer` is a function that takes the Orate input and transforms it into the format that the model expects. In this instance, `cjwbw/audiosep` expects an object with an `audio_file` property and a `text` property that defines the sound to isolate. Also, the `audio_file` property must be a hosted URL. Let's create an input transformer for this:

```ts title="audiosep-utils.ts"
export const inputTransformer = (audio: File) => {
  // Upload audio somewhere
  const url = 'https://www.acme.com/test.mp3';

  return {
    input: {
      audio_file: url,
      text: 'speech',
    },
  };
};
```

#### Output Transformer

The `outputTransformer` is a function that takes the model output and transforms it into the format that Orate expects. In this instance, `cjwbw/audiosep` returns a stream of audio data. Let's create an output transformer for this:

```ts title="audiosep-utils.ts"
export const outputTransformer = async (response) => {
  const stream = response as ReadableStream;
  const reader = stream.getReader();
  const chunks: Uint8Array[] = [];

  while (true) {
    const { done, value } = await reader.read();

    if (done) {
      break;
    }

    chunks.push(value);
  }

  const blob = new Blob(chunks, { type: 'audio/mp3' });

  return new File([blob], 'isolated.mp3', {
    type: 'audio/mpeg',
  });
}
```

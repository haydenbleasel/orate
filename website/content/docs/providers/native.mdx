title: Web Speech API
description: Orate supports the native Web Speech API for speech-to-text.

import { AutoTypeTable } from 'fumadocs-typescript/ui';

The Web Speech API, built into all modern browsers, enables you to incorporate voice data into web apps. It has two parts: `SpeechSynthesis` and `SpeechRecognition`, the latter of which we use for transcription.

## Setup

The Web Speech API provider is available by default in Orate. To import it, you can use the following code:

```ts
import { Native } from 'orate/native';
```

## Configuration

The Native provider does not require any configuration.

## Usage

The Native provider provides a single interface for all of the Web Speech API's functionality.

### Speech to Text

The Native provider provides a `stt` function that allows you to create a speech-to-text transcription function using the Web Speech API.

```ts
import { transcribe } from 'orate';
import { Native } from 'orate/native';

const text = await transcribe({
  model: new Native().stt(),
  audio: new File(...),
});
```

You can specify a language to use by passing it as an option to the `stt` function. If not specified, this defaults to the HTML lang attribute value, or the user agent's language setting if that isn't set either.

```ts
const text = await transcribe({
  model: new Native().stt({ lang: 'en-US' }),
  audio: new File(...),
});
```

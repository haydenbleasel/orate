IBM offers a portfolio of AI products that accelerate generative AI into core workflows, driving automation and productivity, including IBM Watson Speech to Text and Text to Speech.

## Setup

The IBM provider is available by default in Orate. To import it, you can use the following code:

```ts
import { ibm } from 'orate/ibm';
```

## Configuration

The IBM provider looks for the `IBM_API_KEY` environment variable. This variable is required for the provider to work. Simply add the following to your `.env` file:

```bash
IBM_API_KEY="your_api_key"
```

## Usage

The IBM provider provides a single interface for all of IBM's speech and transcription services.

### Text to Speech

The IBM provider provides a `tts` function that allows you to create a text-to-speech synthesis function using IBM Text to Speech. By default, the `tts` function uses the `en-US_AllisonV3Voice` voice.

```tsx
import { speak } from 'orate';
import { ibm } from 'orate/ibm';

const speech = await speak({
  model: ibm.tts(),
  prompt: 'Hello, world!',
});
```

You can specify the model and voice to use by passing them as arguments to the `tts` function.

```tsx
const speech = await speak({
  model: ibm.tts('en-AU_HeidiExpressive'),
  prompt: 'Hello, world!',
});
```

You can also specify specific IBM properties by passing them as an argument to the `tts` function.

```tsx
const speech = await speak({
  model: ibm.tts('en-AU_HeidiExpressive', {
    pitchPercentage: 5,
  }),
  prompt: 'Hello, world!',
});
```

### Speech to Text

The IBM provider provides a `stt` function that allows you to create a speech-to-text transcription function using IBM Speech to Text. By default, the `stt` function uses the `en-US_BroadbandModel` model.

```tsx
import { transcribe } from 'orate';
import { ibm } from 'orate/ibm';

const text = await transcribe({
  model: ibm.stt(),
  audio: someArrayBuffer,
});
```

You can specify the model to use by passing it as an argument to the `stt` function.

```tsx
const text = await transcribe({
  model: ibm.stt('ar-MS_Telephony'),
  audio: someArrayBuffer,
});
```

You can also specify specific IBM properties by passing them as an argument to the `stt` function.

```tsx
const text = await transcribe({
  model: ibm.stt('ar-MS_Telephony', {
    smartFormatting: true,
  }),
  audio: someArrayBuffer,
});
```

Groq are a super fast and efficient AI provider. The LPUâ„¢ Inference Engine by Groq is a hardware and software platform that delivers exceptional compute speed, quality, and energy efficiency. Orate supports Groq's transcription services.

## Setup

The Groq provider is available by default in Orate. To import it, you can use the following code:

```ts
import { groq } from 'orate/groq';
```

## Configuration

The Groq provider looks for the `GROQ_API_KEY` environment variable. This variable is required for the provider to work. Simply add the following to your `.env` file:

```bash
GROQ_API_KEY="your_api_key"
```

## Usage

The Groq provider provides a single interface for all of Groq's transcription services.

### Speech to Text

The Groq provider provides a `stt` function that allows you to create a speech-to-text transcription function using Groq Whisper. By default, the `stt` function uses the `whisper-large-v3` model.

```ts
import { transcribe } from 'orate';
import { groq } from 'orate/groq';

const text = await transcribe({
  model: groq.stt(),
  audio: new File(...),
});
```

You can specify the model to use by passing it as an argument to the `stt` function.

```ts
const text = await transcribe({
  model: groq.stt('whisper-large-v3'),
  audio: new File(...),
});
```

You can also specify specific Groq properties by passing them as an argument to the `stt` function.

```ts
const text = await transcribe({
  model: groq.stt('whisper-large-v3', {
    temperature: 0.5,
  }),
  audio: new File(...),
});
```

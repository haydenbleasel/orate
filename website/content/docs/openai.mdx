OpenAI is a leading provider of AI services, offering a wide range of speech and transcription services through their Large Language Models (LLMs). Orate allows you to use these services with a single API, making it easy to switch between providers and use the best AI services for your needs.

## Setup

The OpenAI provider is available by default in Orate. To import it, you can use the following code:

```ts
import { openai } from 'orate/openai';
```

## Configuration

The OpenAI provider looks for the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable. This variable is required for the provider to work. Simply add the following to your `.env` file:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key"
```

## Usage

The OpenAI provider provides a single interface for all of OpenAI's speech and transcription services.

### Text to Speech

The OpenAI provider provides a `tts` function that allows you to create a text-to-speech synthesis function using OpenAI TTS. By default, the `tts` function uses the `tts-1` model and the `alloy` voice.

```tsx
import { speak } from 'orate';
import { openai } from 'orate/openai';

const openAiSpeech = await speak({
  model: openai.tts(),
  prompt: 'Hello, world!',
});
```

You can specify the model and voice to use by passing them as arguments to the `tts` function.

```tsx
const openAiSpeech = await speak({
  model: openai.tts('tts-1', 'alloy'),
  prompt: 'Hello, world!',
});
```

You can also specify specific OpenAI properties by passing them as an argument to the `tts` function.

```tsx
const openAiSpeech = await speak({
  model: openai.tts('tts-1', 'alloy', {
    speed: 1.25,
  }),
  prompt: 'Hello, world!',
});
```

### Speech to Text

The OpenAI provider provides a `stt` function that allows you to create a speech-to-text transcription function using OpenAI Whisper. By default, the `stt` function uses the `whisper-1` model.

```tsx
import { transcribe } from 'orate';
import { openai } from 'orate/openai';

const openAiText = await transcribe({
  model: openai.stt(),
  audio: someArrayBuffer,
});
```

You can specify the model to use by passing it as an argument to the `stt` function.

```tsx
const openAiText = await transcribe({
  model: openai.stt('whisper-1'),
  audio: someArrayBuffer,
});
```

You can also specify specific OpenAI properties by passing them as a third argument to the `stt` function.

```tsx
const openAiText = await transcribe({
  model: openai.stt('whisper-1', {
    temperature: 0.5,
  }),
  audio: someArrayBuffer,
});
```

## Typescript Definitions

The OpenAI provider provides Typescript definitions for the `tts` and `stt` functions.

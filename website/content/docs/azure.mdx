Azure Cognitive Services by Microsoft are a collection of artificial intelligence (AI) APIs that help developers create applications with advanced AI capabilities. These services are available on Microsoft Azure, a cloud computing platform. 

## Setup

The Azure provider is available by default in Orate. To import it, you can use the following code:

```ts
import { azure } from 'orate/azure';
```

## Configuration

The Azure provider looks for the `AZURE_API_KEY` and `AZURE_REGION` environment variables. These variables are required for the provider to work. Simply add the following to your `.env` file:

```bash
AZURE_API_KEY="your_api_key"
AZURE_REGION="your_region" # e.g. "eastus"
```

## Usage

The Azure provider provides a single interface for all of Azure's speech and transcription services.

### Text to Speech

The Azure provider provides a `tts` function that allows you to create a text-to-speech synthesis function using Azure Speech Service.

```tsx
import { speak } from 'orate';
import { azure } from 'orate/azure';

const speech = await speak({
  model: azure.tts(),
  prompt: 'Hello, world!',
});
```

You can specify the voice to use by passing it as an argument to the `tts` function.

```tsx
const speech = await speak({
  model: azure.tts('en-US-AriaNeural'),
  prompt: 'Hello, world!',
});
```

### Speech to Text

The Azure provider provides a `stt` function that allows you to create a speech-to-text transcription function using Azure Speech Service.

```tsx
import { transcribe } from 'orate';
import { azure } from 'orate/azure';

const text = await transcribe({
  model: azure.stt(),
  audio: someArrayBuffer,
});
```

## Typescript Definitions

The Azure provider provides Typescript definitions for the `tts` and `stt` functions.

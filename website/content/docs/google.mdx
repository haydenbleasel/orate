import { AutoTypeTable } from 'fumadocs-typescript/ui';

Google offers a wide range of speech and transcription services through their Large Language Models (LLMs), including Google Cloud Speech-to-Text and Google Cloud Text-to-Speech.

## Setup

The Google provider is available by default in Orate. To import it, you can use the following code:

```ts
import { google } from 'orate/google';
```

## Configuration

The Google provider looks for the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable. This variable is required for the provider to work. Simply add the following to your `.env` file:

```bash
GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_api_key"
```

## Usage

The Google provider provides a single interface for all of Google's speech and transcription services.

### Text to Speech

The Google provider provides a `tts` function that allows you to create a text-to-speech synthesis function using Google Cloud Text-to-Speech. By default, the `tts` function uses the `en-US-Casual-K` model.

```tsx
import { speak } from 'orate';
import { google } from 'orate/google';

const speech = await speak({
  model: google.tts(),
  prompt: 'Hello, world!',
});
```

You can specify the model to use by passing it as an argument to the `tts` function.

```tsx
const speech = await speak({
  model: google.tts('ar-XA-Wavenet-A'),
  prompt: 'Hello, world!',
});
```

You can also specify specific Google properties by passing them as an argument to the `tts` function.

```tsx
const speech = await speak({
  model: google.tts('ar-XA-Wavenet-A', {
    advancedVoiceOptions: {
      lowLatencyJourneySynthesis: true,
    },
  }),
  prompt: 'Hello, world!',
});
```

### Speech to Text

The Google provider provides a `stt` function that allows you to create a speech-to-text transcription function using Google Cloud Speech-to-Text. Google is unique in the fact that you need to specify a recognizer.

```tsx
import { transcribe } from 'orate';
import { google } from 'orate/google';

const text = await transcribe({
  model: google.stt('projects/{project}/locations/{region}/recognizers/{recognizer}'),
  audio: someArrayBuffer,
});
```

You can also specify specific Google properties by passing them as an argument to the `stt` function.

```tsx
const text = await transcribe({
  model: google.stt('projects/{project}/locations/{region}/recognizers/{recognizer}', {
    config: {
      adaptation: {
        phraseSets: {
          phrases: ['hello', 'world'],
        },
      },
    },
  }),
  audio: someArrayBuffer,
});
```

## Typescript Definitions

The Google provider provides Typescript definitions for the `tts` and `stt` functions.

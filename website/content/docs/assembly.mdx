AssemblyAI is a leader in Speech AI to power world-class products with unmatched accuracy, breakthrough speech-to-text models, and profound speech understanding.

## Setup

The AssemblyAI provider is available by default in Orate. To import it, you can use the following code:

```ts
import { assemblyai } from 'orate/assemblyai';
```

## Configuration

The AssemblyAI provider looks for the `ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY` environment variable. This variable is required for the provider to work. Simply add the following to your `.env` file:

```bash
ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY="your_api_key"
```

## Usage

The AssemblyAI provider provides a single interface for all of AssemblyAI's transcription services.

### Speech to Text

The AssemblyAI provider provides a `stt` function that allows you to create a speech-to-text transcription function using AssemblyAI. By default, the `stt` function uses the `best` model.

```tsx
import { transcribe } from 'orate';
import { assemblyai } from 'orate/assemblyai';

const assemblyAiText = await transcribe({
  model: assemblyai.stt(),
  audio: someArrayBuffer,
});
```

You can specify the model to use by passing it as an argument to the `stt` function.

```tsx
const assemblyAiText = await transcribe({
  model: assemblyai.stt('nano'),
  audio: someArrayBuffer,
});
```

You can also specify specific AssemblyAI properties by passing them as an argument to the `stt` function.

```tsx
const assemblyAiText = await transcribe({
  model: assemblyai.stt('nano', {
    punctuate: false,
  }),
  audio: someArrayBuffer,
});
```

## Typescript Definitions

The AssemblyAI provider provides Typescript definitions for the `stt` function.

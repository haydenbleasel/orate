Play.ai generates AI voices indistinguishable from humans with ultra realistic text to speech from the leading multi voice AI voice generator. Orate offers a single interface for all of Play.ai's speech services.

## Setup

The Play.ai provider is available by default in Orate. To import it, you can use the following code:

```ts
import { play } from 'orate/play';
```

## Configuration

The Play.ai provider looks for the `PLAY_API_KEY` and `PLAY_USER_ID` environment variables. These variables are required for the provider to work. Simply add the following to your `.env` file:

```bash
PLAY_API_KEY="your_api_key"
PLAY_USER_ID="your_user_id"
```

## Usage

The Play.ai provider provides a single interface for all of Play.ai's speech services.

### Text to Speech

The Play.ai provider provides a `tts` function that allows you to create a text-to-speech synthesis function using Play.ai TTS. By default, the `tts` function uses the `Play3.0-mini` model and the `Angelo` voice.

```ts
import { speak } from 'orate';
import { play } from 'orate/play';

const speech = await speak({
  model: play.tts(),
  prompt: 'Hello, world!',
});
```

The voice can be the name of a default voice e.g. `Angelo` or the ID of a custom voice e.g. `s3://voice-cloning-zero-shot/.../original/manifest.json`.

You can specify the model and voice to use by passing them as arguments to the `tts` function.

```ts
const speech = await speak({
  model: play.tts('PlayDialog', 's3://voice-cloning-zero-shot/baf1ef41-36b6-428c-9bdf-50ba54682bd8/original/manifest.json'),
  prompt: 'Hello, world!',
});
```

You can also specify specific Play.ai properties by passing them as an argument to the `tts` function.

```ts
const speech = await speak({
  model: play.tts('PlayDialog', 's3://voice-cloning-zero-shot/baf1ef41-36b6-428c-9bdf-50ba54682bd8/original/manifest.json', {
    speed: 1.25,
  }),
  prompt: 'Hello, world!',
});
```

description: What Orate is and what it does.
---

Orate is an artificial intelligence (AI) toolkit focused on speech, helping you create realistic, human-like speech and transcribe audio with a unified API that works with leading AI providers like OpenAI, ElevenLabs and AssemblyAI.

## Why use Orate?

Integrating AI services can be difficult and each provider has their own APIs and SDKs which varies in functionality and quality. Each provider takes and returns different formats, making it difficult to switch between providers. Additionally, many LLM speech SDKs do not have solid Typescript definitions for things like models and voices.

Orate solves these problems by providing a unified API with a single interface, allowing you to easily switch between providers and use the best AI services for your needs.

## Providers

Companies such as OpenAI, ElevenLabs and AssemblyAI offer speech and transcription services through the use of their own Large Language Models (LLMs). Orate allows you to use these services with a single API, making it easy to switch between providers and use the best AI services for your needs.

Orate supports a wide range of providers, including [OpenAI](/docs/providers/openai), [ElevenLabs](/docs/providers/elevenlabs), [AssemblyAI](/docs/providers/assemblyai) and more. You can find more information about each provider in the sidebar.

We also support the [Native Web Speech API](/docs/providers/native) as a provider.

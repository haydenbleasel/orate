## Installation

Orate is available as an npm package. You can install it with your preferred package manager.

```package-install
orate
```

## Getting Started

After installing Orate, you can import the various functions from the package...

```ts
import { speak, transcribe, change, isolate } from 'orate';
```

... as well as the providers you want to use.

```ts
import { ElevenLabs } from 'orate/providers/elevenlabs';
```

Then, you can use the provider with the function you want to use:

```ts
import { speak, transcribe, change, isolate } from 'orate';
import { ElevenLabs } from 'orate/providers/elevenlabs';

const speech = await speak({
  model: elevenlabs.tts('eleven_multilingual_v2', 'bill'),
  prompt: 'Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears!',
});
```

## Streaming

Orate supports streaming where possible for all functions, depending on the provider.

To use streaming, you can pass the `stream` option to the function.

```ts
const stream = await speak({
  model: elevenlabs.tts('eleven_multilingual_v2', 'bill'),
  prompt: 'Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears!',
  stream: true,
});
```

## Responses

Orate functions return different types of responses depending on the function and whether streaming is enabled:

### `speak`

The `speak` function converts text to speech:

- Without streaming: Returns a `Promise<File>` containing the generated audio
- With streaming: Returns a `Promise<ReadableStream>` for streaming the audio

### `transcribe`

The `transcribe` function converts audio to text:

- Without streaming: Returns a `Promise<string>` containing the transcribed text
- With streaming: Returns a `Promise<ReadableStream>` for streaming the transcribed text

### `change`

The `change` function changes the voice of an audio file:

- Without streaming: Returns a `Promise<File>` containing the changed audio
- With streaming: Returns a `Promise<ReadableStream>` for streaming the changed audio

### `isolate`

The `isolate` function isolates speech from an audio file:

- Without streaming: Returns a `Promise<File>` containing the isolated speech
- With streaming: Returns a `Promise<ReadableStream>` for streaming the isolated speech

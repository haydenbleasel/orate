import { AutoTypeTable } from 'fumadocs-typescript/ui';

ElevenLabs creates emotionally & contextually aware AI voices. Their voice AI responds to emotional cues in text and adapts its delivery to suit both the immediate content and the wider context. This lets their AI voices achieve high emotional range and avoid making logical errors.

## Setup

The ElevenLabs provider is available by default in Orate. To import it, you can use the following code:

```ts
import { elevenlabs } from 'orate/elevenlabs';
```

## Configuration

The ElevenLabs provider looks for the `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` environment variable. This variable is required for the provider to work. Simply add the following to your `.env` file:

```bash
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY="your_api_key"
```

## Usage

The ElevenLabs provider provides a single interface for all of ElevenLabs' speech and transcription services.

### Text to Speech

The ElevenLabs provider provides a `tts` function that allows you to create a text-to-speech synthesis function using ElevenLabs. By default, the `tts` function uses the `multilingual_v2` model and the `aria` voice.

```ts
import { speak } from 'orate';
import { elevenlabs } from 'orate/elevenlabs';

const speech = await speak({
  model: elevenlabs.tts(),
  prompt: 'Hello, world!',
});
```

You can specify the model and voice to use by passing them as arguments to the `tts` function.

```ts
const speech = await speak({
  model: elevenlabs.tts('english_sts_v2', 'charlotte'),
  prompt: 'Hello, world!',
});
```

The voice can be the name of a default voice e.g. `charlotte` or the ID of a custom voice e.g. `rxQ8sHg3rojjgBilXbSC`.

You can also specify specific ElevenLabs properties by passing them as an argument to the `tts` function.

```ts
const speech = await speak({
  model: elevenlabs.tts('english_sts_v2', 'charlotte', {
    voice_settings: {
      stability: 0.5,
    },
  }),
  prompt: 'Hello, world!',
});
```

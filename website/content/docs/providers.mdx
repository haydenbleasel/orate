Companies such as OpenAI, ElevenLabs and AssemblyAI offer speech and transcription services through the use of their own Large Language Models (LLMs). Orate allows you to use these services with a single API, making it easy to switch between providers and use the best AI services for your needs.

Here are the providers that Orate currently supports:

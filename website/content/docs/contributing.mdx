Thank you for your interest in contributing to Orate! This guide will help you get started with development, testing, and adding new providers.

## Development Setup

1. Fork and clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `pnpm install`

## Adding a New Provider

To add a new AI provider to Orate, follow these steps:

1. Create a new directory in `src/` for your provider
2. Create an `index.ts` file with the provider implementation
3. Add TypeScript types for the provider's models and voices if applicable
4. Implement the provider interface:

```ts
export const yourProvider = {
  // Implement text-to-speech if supported
  tts: (model?: string, voice?: string, properties?: any) => {
    // Provider implementation
    return async (prompt: string) => {
      // Convert text to speech
      return new File([audioBuffer], 'speech.mp3', { type: 'audio/mpeg' });
    };
  },
  
  // Implement speech-to-text if supported
  stt: (model?: string, properties?: any) => {
    // Provider implementation
    return async (audio: File) => {
      // Convert speech to text
      return transcribedText;
    };
  },
};
```

5. Add tests in `__tests__/yourProvider.test.ts`
6. Add documentation in `website/content/docs/yourProvider.mdx`
7. Update the providers list in:
   - `website/content/docs/providers.mdx`
   - `website/content/docs/meta.json`
   - `website/app/(home)/components/providers.tsx`

## Environment Variables

Each provider has its own test file that verifies both text-to-speech and speech-to-text functionality where applicable. You'll need to set up the appropriate environment variables for the providers you want to test.

Required environment variables for testing existing providers:

- OpenAI: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- ElevenLabs: `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`
- AssemblyAI: `ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY`
- Google: `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_RECOGNIZER`
- IBM: `IBM_TTS_API_KEY`, `IBM_TTS_URL`, `IBM_STT_API_KEY`, `IBM_STT_URL`
- Azure: `AZURE_API_KEY`, `AZURE_REGION`
- Gladio: `GLADIO_API_KEY`
- Murf: `MURF_API_KEY`
- Deepgram: `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY`
- Rev: `REV_API_KEY`

## Running Tests

Orate uses Vitest for testing. The test files can be found in the `__tests__` directory.

To run the tests:

```bash
pnpm test
```

This should output a list of tests that have been run e.g.

```sh
✓ __tests__/azure.test.ts (2 tests) 1444ms
  ✓ Azure Tests > should convert text to speech 463ms
  ✓ Azure Tests > should convert speech to text 981ms
✓ __tests__/elevenlabs.test.ts (1 test) 1568ms
  ✓ ElevenLabs Tests > should convert text to speech 1567ms
✓ __tests__/openai.test.ts (2 tests) 1991ms
  ✓ OpenAI Tests > should convert text to speech 1298ms
  ✓ OpenAI Tests > should convert speech to text 692ms
✓ __tests__/ibm.test.ts (2 tests) 5126ms
  ✓ IBM Tests > should convert text to speech 2207ms
  ✓ IBM Tests > should convert speech to text 2918ms
✓ __tests__/assembly.test.ts (1 test) 4307ms
  ✓ AssemblyAI Tests > should convert speech to text 4306ms
❯ __tests__/google.test.ts (2 tests) 11013ms
  ✓ Google Tests > should convert text to speech 8580ms
  ✓ Google Tests > should convert speech to text 2432ms
```

## Code Style

Orate uses Biome with the Ultracite configuration for code formatting and linting. You can follow the setup guide on the [Ultracite website](https://www.ultracite.dev/).

Once setup correctly, it should format your code automatically when you save. If not, you can run `npx ultracite` to format your code.

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. Create a new branch for your changes
2. Make your changes and commit them with descriptive messages
3. Push your branch to your fork
4. Submit a pull request to the main Orate repository

Thank you for your contribution!

## Writing Documentation

The documentation is built using Next.js and Fumadocs. To run the documentation site locally, `cd` into the `website` directory and run:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Documentation is written in Markdown and can be found in the `website/content/docs` directory. The `meta.json` file contains the metadata for the documentation pages.
